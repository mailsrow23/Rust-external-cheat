#### 1. If you are using kÄ±rekÄ±d Rust extract the game and open press on rust and press on RustClient otherwise it will not work. 

#### 2. Now, if you use Steam to use this hack, you need to go to settings on Rust and go to properties, local files and browse. Then open RustClient 

#### 3. when you are in the game, you need to open the loader and wait

#### 4. now go into the game you want to hack and wait 3 seconds it will say injector successful, and now you can have fun (if you use on ladder, you can only jump two more times whit it. If you do more, you will get banned from the server)
